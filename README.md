# MinimalDiscordBot

A basic working example of a discord bot. In the cog.py file you can add bot commands by using the @commands.command() decorator.
A Discord bot token should be added in the .env file, you can get this token by creating a bot user in the Discord developer portal: https://discord.com/developers/applications
